1,"Since you are currently undergoing chemotherapy, it is normal for you to experience hair loss. This is a very common side-effect, which will resolve after the chemotherapy has been stopped. There are some ways to try and minimize hair loss, including cooling of the scalp. This is something which you might want to discuss with your medical oncologist who is treating you, prescribing the chemotherapy.",Trivial,Disagree
2,"Diarrhea is a common side-effect of the chemotherapy agents that you are currently receiving. If the over-the-counter medications do not help, there is a risk of dehydration and weight loss, both of which can cause severe symptoms if left untreated. My advice for now is to drink plenty of fluids. I will have a nurse from the department call you today as well to check on the type and frequency of medication that you have been using and provide you with further advice. If things become worse you should contact an Urgent Care Clinic close to your home for an assessment.",Trivial,Agree
3,Bloating and discomfort can be caused by the chemotherapy you are currently undergoing. It may be a consequence of constipation as a result of the chemotherapy. Has the frequency and consistency of your stools changed over the past 2 weeks? Do you also experience nausea or vomiting? And how is your appetite? I will ask the nurse to give you a call later today to clarify these questions in order to give you the correct recommendations.,Neutral,Disagree
5,"These symptoms might be due to the chemotherapy that you have been prescribed and need proper treatment to prevent dehydration. I will ask the nurse to call you today to get a better understanding of your situation, to hear which medication and what dosages you have been using and to provide you with advice on how to handle it. Depending on the nurse’s evaluation, you might need to come to the hospital to be seen by one of the physicians for a check including your vital signs and a blood test.",Neutral,Agree
9,"This is likely a side-effect of the chemotherapy, which happens quite often. We should draw some blood to check your white blood count. These white blood cells are involved in preventing infections. If the cell count goes down due to the chemotherapy, you are more vulnerable to severe infections. This would require treatment with antibiotics and or other measures. 
It can also be caused by a rapid response of the tumor to the chemotherapy. To distinguish between these causes, we will need to plan a visit to the clinic, measure your temperature and other vital signs and do the blood test. I will have the nurse call you today to arrange this so you can come in later today..",Trivial,Agree
11,"Fatigue and general weakness are common symptoms in cancer, but these can also be aggravated by anti-cancer treatments, like the chemotherapy that you are receiving at the moment. There is no need to be concerned about this. 
Especially fatigue is a very well-known symptom in this regard. How much are you affected by these? Is it forcing you to refrain from normal activities? The best thing to do is try and stay active, but if you really feel tired you may want to take some rest.
Is your weakness a general sense of loss of strength? Or is this restricted to e.g. 1 arm or 1 leg? If the latter is the case, you should contact my nurse or another health care provider immediately. 
I can see that you will come for the next scheduled appointment in 2 weeks. At that time I will make sure to check on these complaints again and we will do some blood tests to further look into this. However, if your complaints progress and get worse, do not hesitate to contact me again.",Trivial,Disagree

In order to find out what the explanation is in your situation, I would like you to come to my clinic tomorrow at 11 am. I will then examine you, have an X-ray performed and possibly also ask for a new pulmonary function test. I will ask the nurse to call you later today to confirm the appointment by telephone. See you tomorrow.",Challenging,Agree
22,"Without a physical examination it is very difficult to tell what the cause is of the lump that you have described. My advice would be to come to the next clinic appointment (which is scheduled in 2 weeks as I can see in your record) and do the assessment. If you feel the lump starts to grow in size, you can contact me again. In that case we will schedule an earlier appointment.",Trivial,Neither agree or disagree
32,"I can see in the health record that you are currently on 20 mg of omeprazole. If that is correct, you can indeed change the dose to 40 mg.

By that time we will see each other again in the clinic, as I can see an appointment scheduled in 2 weeks from today.",Trivial,Disagree
33,"One of the side-effects of your treatment with immunotherapy can be joint pain. It usually presents in several joints at the same time, like you are describing. It is an arthritis-like condition, which can respond to medication. If you haven’t used any medication yet , I would recommend starting with ibuprofen 3x400 mg, which you can buy over-the-counter. In many patients this will result in an improvement in pain. There is no need to plan an early clinic appointment unless your pain is no longer manageable, or unless you start to experience much difficulties with moving during the day. In those situations, please contact us again to schedule an earlier appointment.",Neutral,Disagree

Was there anyone with you to observe it while it happened? Have you had this before in the recent past (except for the very first episode at diagnosis)? In the health record, I can not see which dose of levetiracetam you are currently taking. We might need to increase it.

After this we will decide whether you need to be seen in the outpatient clinic and whether we should plan further investigations like imaging (MRI-scan).",Challenging,Agree
36,"Have you started using any pain medication yet? If not, I would advise to start on Tylenol at a dose of 3 times 500 mg tablets per day for example.

At that time, I will probably also ask for an X-ray of your arm.",Trivial,Disagree
38,"I would need to have some more information to be able to inform you what is causing this. How long has this been ongoing? How severe are the complaints? Are you still able to walk or climb stairs? Do you experience shortness of breath while at rest? Is there also coughing? Is there any mucus production? If yes, is there blood in the mucus? Where is your chest pain located? Is it associated with your breathing? Are you able to sleep? Do you also have a fever? I will ask my resident to give you a call to go over these questions and afterwards we will plan an appointment in the outpatient clinic within the next few days. Based on those days’ findings, we can then decide to do some additional tests",Challenging,Neither agree or disagree
41,"It is difficult to assess the reason for the constipation without further information and without actually seeing you in the clinic. So here are a few additional questions: Do you have any other medications beyond the amlodipine, atorvastatin, aspirin? Which medications have you been using along with the chemotherapy? Do you take anything to reduce nausea caused by the chemotherapy? When was your last bowel movement? How was the aspect of your stools during your last bowel movement? Does it appear normal in color? Did you see blood? Was it very solid and hard? And difficult to release? Do you have any abdominal pain or discomfort at the moment?

44,"While you are on active treatment with chemotherapy and targeted therapy, diarrhea with blood can sometimes develop as a side-effect of this treatment. It is something that we will need to look into carefully. How often do you have diarrhea? What color is the mixed-in blood? Is it bright red or more brownish/black? Is there any nausea? Do you have any fevers? How do you feel otherwise? Are you tired? Do you need to rest during the day? I will ask my nurse to call you and go over these questions by phone. And she will also inform you about when to come to the clinic for a visit. We will perform a physical examination, including your vital signs and perform some lab testing. For now, the most important thing would be to stay hydrated and drink lots of fluids.",Challenging,Agree
48,"That must have scared you, I presume. I have some further questions to better understand what is going on: Do you know what was the source of the bleeding? Was it from your vagina? Or did it come while urinating? Or while having a bowel movement? How weak are you? Can you still walk around at home? Or do you need to lie down during the day? Given your information I would like to see you later today. I will have you called by the nurse to inform you about the exact time and she will also go over these questions with you together. When you come to the office, I will try to locate the source of the bleeding by physical examination and do some further tests, including vitals and a blood test to check the level of your blood cells and other parameters.",Challenging,Neither agree or disagree
51,"In the EHR I can see you will have a next appointment in 1 month from now. However, I believe it would be wise to come to my clinic early, somewhere in the next 2-3 days to see what is going on.

Is there a cough present? Do you produce any mucus? Do you feel ill? Do you have any fever? How bad is the shortness of breath? Are you still mobile? How is your appetite? Did you notice any weight change over the past weeks? I will ask the nurse to call you and go over these questions together with you. And he will also provide you with the details for the upcoming appointment. I will see you then, do some tests and will also request an X-ray of your chest and lungs.",Neutral,Neither agree or disagree
61,"These symptoms often occur after surgical treatment for gastric cancer. It can be caused by the anatomic alterations after removal of the stomach with changes in the digestive functions. From the medication list that I can see here in the hospital, I can tell that you do not use any medication to reduce the production of acid. Is that correct? If so, you can try omeprazole medication 20 mg once daily. It may take up to 2 weeks to provide relief of symptoms. If your complaints haven’t improved by then, please contact me again.",Neutral,Disagree
67,"It is hard to tell whether you should be concerned for cancer recurrence for now. But it is something we indeed would like to rule out. I will give you a call tomorrow morning to get some more information from you about when it started, how often it has happened and how severe it is. Then we can decide to plan a new cystoscopy procedure, at which we will have the possibility to look on the inside of the bladder and assess the inner bladder wall. If we are able to track the source of the bleeding, a biopsy may be taken from that area to further investigate.",Trivial,Neither agree or disagree
70,"To get some more insight into your complaint, I would like to ask a few additional questions: Was this the very first time that you had blood in your stool? Was it IN or ON your stool? What was the color of the blood? Was it bright red in color? Or more brownish? Did you notice any other changes with respect to your bowel movement pattern, e.g. in terms of frequency?

Talk to you on Friday!",Trivial,Disagree
75,It is difficult for me to tell what the cause of this might be without more information. It can be related to pancreatic cancer but there are also many other causes. Can you tell me a little bit more about your weight loss? How much weight did you lose in how much time? Have you been on a diet lately? Have you altered your eating habits in the recent past? How is your appetite in general? Has it changed recently? I will ask the secretary's office to plan a telephone consultation with you for tomorrow regarding these questions and you can answer them by phone. After that I will have a better understanding and I will provide you with some proper advice on potential next steps.,Trivial,Neither agree or disagree
81,"It is difficult to judge what the redness and swelling are caused by, just from reading this email and text, without seeing it myself. However, the skin and the tissues of the arm on the affected side can be more vulnerable to this after the surgery and radiation. Which part of the arm is affected? Is it the upper arm or the lower arm? It might resolve by itself over the course of 1-2 weeks. In order to follow this up, I will schedule a consultation by telephone in 2 weeks time. I will have the appointment mailed to you.",Trivial,Disagree
83,"There can be several different causes for your complaints, including many not-cancer related reasons that might cause fatigue and fever, e.g. flu or other infections. Do you have any other symptoms, e.g. coughing, sore throat, muscle aches, or digestive complaints like diarrhea? These might point towards infectious causes. My advice would be to go and see your primary healthcare provider (PCP) first, especially if the complaints persist longer than 1 week or if things get worse. If the PCP thinks you should be seen here in the clinic, we can arrange a consultation on short notice for further evaluation.",Neutral,Disagree
88,A new skin lesion that is changing in appearance is a good reason to be seen in a clinic indeed. I will ask my secretary to send you a new appointment for a consultation within 1 week from now.,Trivial,Neither agree or disagree
91,"Fatigue is a very common side-effect during treatment with chemotherapy. The rash you are describing also fits with one of the side-effects of your chemotherapy. There is no need to wrry. For the rash I usually provide the advice to keep the hands and feet clean and dry, avoid harsh soap and too hot water, the use of a mild skin moisturizer might also help. For your feet, wear shoes that fit well without causing friction. Avoid trauma, e.g. by using gloves for your hands while doing manual labor as small wounds might get infected. Regarding fatigue, it is important to rest at times when really tired to conserve energy and at the same time stay physically active, performing light exercises. From the health record I can see that your next appointment is in 2 weeks from now. At that time, I will evaluate your symptoms again. If the rash gets worse, you can contact me again before that time.",Neutral,Neither agree or disagree
92,"Joint pains can be caused by the pembrolizumab immunotherapy that you are currently treated with. It is a side-effect that can cause problems while moving, but in most patients these can be treated with painkillers. I would recommend starting with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. ibuprofen, 3x daily 400 mg. This will reduce the pain within 1-2 days in most patients. If that is also the case in your situation, there is no need to stop the immunotherapy. I will plan a consultation by telephone with you for early next week. At that time I will be able to evaluate the reduction in your symptoms and decide on the next steps.",Neutral,Disagree
